# Bmi-Calculator
The BMI Calculator in Flutter is a mobile application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. Body Mass Index is a numerical value that indicates whether a person's weight is healthy in relation to their height.

The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface where users can input their height and weight. Once the values are entered, the BMI Calculator uses the BMI formula, which is BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m))^2, to calculate the BMI.

The calculated BMI value is then displayed to the user along with a corresponding weight category. The weight categories typically include classifications such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. These categories help users understand where their BMI falls on the scale of healthy weight ranges.

The BMI Calculator in Flutter is designed to be easy to use and provides a convenient tool for individuals who want to assess their weight status based on their height and weight. It can be a useful tool for monitoring personal health and making informed decisions regarding lifestyle and fitness goals.

Please note that the BMI Calculator is a general tool and does not take into account other factors such as body composition, muscle mass, or individual health conditions. It is always recommended to consult a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment of one's health and weight management.
